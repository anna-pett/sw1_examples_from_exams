# sw1_examples_from_exams

this is a collection of examples from exams in course software 1.<br>
it's divided into packages by subject, subpackages are exam_name.question_number.

mostly this is just the code from the exam as is, but sometimes i added explanations and/or additional usage examples/implementations.
this additional code is marked as `// added code`.

suggested use cases;
* after solving an exam, come over here and look for relevant code to play with.

* when learning a specific subject (polymorphism, nested classes, streams etc.), go to the package named after the subject and go over the examples there.

this collection is still growing and pull requests are welcome.


p.s
the biggest and most amorphous package is polymorphism, it includes mostly questions about overriding and overloading methods.
